This bird’s sending me on a goose chase, Dispatcher. I got nothing.
<>I appreciate the update.[#DSA.1.2]

[Barb.1.1.S]{Barb1.1}
Looks like she was last at Pete’s Malts with her guy. Nobody’s seen them since, Hun, but I’ll keep an eye out.

[Barb.1.1.F]
I went to Pete’s Malts, where we last saw the—bzzzzzz—but I got stood up. Promise you’ll come next time?
<>I do like a malt. Maybe next time, Barb.[#DSA.1.2]

[Jack.1.1.S]
Zzzzzz—scoured Pete’s Malts, found an old friend. Told me he saw the two doves—bzzzzzzttt—down to lover’s lane. I’ll take a peek, over.
<>Keep me updated.[#DSA.1.2]

[Jack.1.1.F]
I ain’t got nothing, Dispatcher. Cashier at Pete’s Malts said he saw the two leave, but—zzzzzzttttt—they went.

Poor bird’s been gutted. We found—zzzzzt—that has her boyfriend’s name on it. We’re gonna track him down, over.
<>She didn’t deserve that. Go get ‘em, Dick. Over.[#1.3]

<>Thanks for looking. Over.[#1.3]
;


[Barb.1.2.S]{1.2}
I examined the poor girl’s body. Looks like there’s been a struggle, and she’s missing a lot of her clothing. I think her boyfriend tried somethin’ foul and she got spooked. Poor girl.
<>That’s disgusting. We need to catch him. Send out an APB.[#1.3]
;


[Jack.1.2.S]{1.2}
Someone cut the poor girl open with a—bbzzzzt—with, get this, the boyfriend’s name on it. It looks like she was in a fight, too, with bruises on her arms and torn clothes. We’re looking for him now.
<>Christ, Jack. I’ll have the Sergeant tell her parents.[#1.3]
;


[Jack.1.2.F]
Looks like we found the girl. No weapon, no footprints, no nothing. Whoever did this was clean. The boyfriend has an alibi, Dispatcher. We’re stuck.
<>Damnit! Thanks for your work, Jack.[#1.3]

His dad posted bail. Something tells me this is the last we’ll see of the kid. Over.
<>That miscreant. Maybe we’ll get lucky and someone’ll pick him up.[break]
;


[1.4.Arrest.Dick] {!1.2}
We caught the kid. Slime ball wanted to post bail, but we had enough—zzzzzt—to convince the judge otherwise. He’ll be in jail ‘til he’s 50, Dispatcher. He deserves it. Over.
<>Another scoundrel where he belongs. Good work.[break]

<Dick.1.2> What’s the skinny, Jack?[1.4.Bail.Jack]
<1.2> What is it?[1.4.Arrest.Jack]

[1.4.Bail.Jack]
We caught the boyfriend, Dispatcher. His—bbzzzzz—father posted bail, though. We didn’t have enough to convince the judge to hold the kid. I’m afraid that might be the last we see of—zzzzttt.
<>That miscreant! We’ve done all we can.[break]
;


[1.4.Arrest.Jack]
We caught the boyfriend, Dispatcher. His—bbzzzzz—father tried to post bail, but we talked to the Judge. That kid’s gonna be in jail until he’s bald.
<>Good work, Jack.[break]

I’ve hunted all over town, but I can’t find him, Dispatcher. I hope that kid didn’t skip town.
