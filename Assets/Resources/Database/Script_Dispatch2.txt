Dispatcher, this is Sarge--zzzzzttt. We have a report that two men are fighting at Trixie’s Bar on--bzzzzzzzzzz. Send back--bbbbbbzzzz.
<>Barb will be there to clean up.[DialBarb.2.1]
<>Jack can break that off, expect him soon. [DialJack.2.1]
<>I’m sending Dick in. [DialDick.2.1]

[DialDick.2.1]
Where am I going? Over.
<>Head to the Sergeant. Over.[Dick.2.1.S][Dick.2.1.F]
<>Whoops, sorry to bother you. Over.[Start]

[DialBarb.2.1]
Hello, Dahling. Finally takin’ me to lunch?
. . .No? One of these days. Where are you sendin’ me, then?
<>Head to the Sergeant.[Barb.2.1.S][Barb.2.1.S][Barb.2.1.S][Barb.2.1.S][Barb.2.1.F][Barb.2.1.F][Barb.2.1.F]
<>Whoops, sorry to bother you.[Start]

[DialJack.2.1]
No need to bust my chops, just tell me where to go.
<>Head to the Sergeant.[Jack.2.1.S][Jack.2.1.S][Jack.2.1.S][Jack.2.1.F]
<>Whoops, sorry to bother you.[Start]

[Dick.2.1.S] {2.1.Interrogation}
We caught the two men, Dispatcher. Looks like they got in a fight o’er drug money. We’re taking them in for questioning. Over.
<>Great. Thank you, Dick. Over.[Start]
;


[Dick.2.1.F] {2.1.Wound}
That was a disaster. One man dead with a--zzzz--stuck in ‘is head, one arrested. Don’t know what else we could do here, Dispatcher. Over.
<>Take care, Dick. Over.[Start]
;


[Barb.2.1.S] {2.1.SavedLife}
That was a right mess you sent me to. Two men smashing--zzzzz--over each other’s heads. Had to send him to the hospital!
He seemed repentant, though.
<>Good, thank you. I hope we can get some information from him.[break]
;


[Barb.2.1.F]
I got there and the two guys are nothin’ more than bruises. The Sargeant took them away in cuffs. Not much else we could’ve done.
<>Thanks, Barb.[break]
;


[Jack.2.1.S]
Sargeant and I arrested two men. It looks like they had something personal on the other one, but neither one is talking.
<>It’s up to the guards, now. Thanks.[break]
;


[Jack.2.1.F]
One of the guys dropped, the other having nailed him with--bzzzzzz. We arrested the other and took him in, but it doesn’t look like there’s anything else we can do.
<>I appreciate it, Jack.[break]
