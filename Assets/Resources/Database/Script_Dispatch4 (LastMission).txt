You wouldn’t believe it, Dispatcher. We had a standoff, two guys against four of our guys. They took hostages, so we couldn’t shoot.
Finally, one of the hostages punched the guy and all hell broke loose. We killed the two men. And found cocaine on their bodies. Think it might’ve been gang related. Over.

No, I’m okay. Sometimes I wish it were me in that control booth, Dispatch. Over.

Holy cow, Dahling, you missed one heck of a fight. The men took hostages during the shootout, an’ we couldn’t fire back. I had to hide in the ambulance ‘til some scuffle happened between the two men.
Well, they went and shot one another! One died, but I got to save the other. And don’t you know, when I was mendin’ him up, I saw some other man run out the back!
<>The one man you saved, where is he now?[4.1.2]

This is Sergeant--bzzzzzt--with a--zzzzz--opportunity, Dispatch. We have intel that the drugs we found on the two men came from--bzzzzzzt--gang. We think they’re hiring a--bzzzz--for a prison break. We need people to take care of a few things.
First, someone has to do a controlled leak to the Daily--bzzzzzz. Who would you like to send?
<>Dick Wilson has the most information, he should go [Dick.Press].
<>Barb Moore is the most charismatic, she should go.[Barb.Press]
<>Jack Martin is the most careful, he should go.[Jack.Press]

[Dick.Press] {d.pr}
Next is to pick up supplies from Pittsburgh. They’re lending us guns and dogs.
<>Barb Moore has the most driving experience, she should go.[Barb.Pitt]
<>Jack Martin knows the force the best, he should go. [Jack.Pitt2]
;


[Barb.Pitt]{b.pi, j.prison}
Last is to coordinate with the prison guards.

Dahling, thank you. I haven’t seen Ruby since college. I had no idea she was at the Daily--bzzzzz! I told her about the prison break, and we got to catch up on missed years!
You’re next, you know. You’ve promised several dinners.

Does Saturday work for you?

I got the supplies, no problem. We’re driving back now.

Dispatch, this is Jake. I have bad news. Pittsburgh deliveries never came in, so they don’t have anything to spare. We don’t be getting what we asked for.

<supplies.F> It’s a shame we didn’t get support from Pittsburgh.[14.2]

[14.1]
Yes, and I have to say; I feel a bit like a movie set surrounded by all these trained dogs. Even if someone gets out the building, they’re not getting way from these hounds.
<>Good to hear. I trust you to keep us safe.[18.1]

I hate to say it, but we can’t do much. I have two trained dogs, but they won’t do much good against a mob.
