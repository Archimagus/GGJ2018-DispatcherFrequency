Dispatch, I have three people for you to work with this week.
The first is Dick Wilson, an ex-marine who has served us in the Harrisburg PD faithfully.
The second is Barb Moore, an EMT with a healing touch.
The third is gumshoe Jack Martin, who excels at stalking and tracking.
<>I look forward to working with them.[0.2]
