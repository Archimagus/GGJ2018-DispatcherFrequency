<>Thanks for looking. Over.[Event.Wait]
;


[Barb.1.2.S]{1.2}
I examined the poor girl’s body. Looks like there’s been a struggle, and she’s missing a lot of her clothing. I think her boyfriend tried somethin’ foul and she got spooked. Poor girl.

;


[Jack.1.2.S]{1.2}
Someone cut the poor girl open with a—bbzzzzt—with, get this, the boyfriend’s name on it. It looks like she was in a fight, too, with bruises on her arms and torn clothes. We’re looking for him now.
<>Christ, Jack. I’ll have the Sergeant tell her parents.[Event.Wait]
;


[Jack.1.2.F]
Looks like we found the girl. No weapon, no footprints, no nothing. Whoever did this was clean. The boyfriend has an alibi, Dispatcher. We’re stuck.

<Dick.1.2> What’s the skinny, Jack?[1.4.Bail.Jack]
<1.2> What is it?[1.4.Arrest.Jack]


[1.4.Bail.Jack]
We caught the boyfriend, Dispatcher. His—bbzzzzz—father posted bail, though. We didn’t have enough to convince the judge to hold the kid. I’m afraid that might be the last we see of—zzzzttt.

He seemed repentant, though.
<>Good, thank you. I hope we can get some information from him.[Event.Wait]

[Barb.2.1.F]
I got there and the two guys are nothin’ more than bruises. The Sargeant took them away in cuffs. Not much else we could’ve done.
